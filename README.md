# Image Resizer Project 🌼


## Overview 🚀
Welcome to the Image Resizer project! This Python-based tool, powered by the OpenCV library, empowers you to effortlessly resize images for various applications. Whether you're optimizing images for the web or preparing datasets for machine learning, this project simplifies the process with a user-friendly script.

## Features 🌟
- **Simplicity at its Core:** Easily configure the script with source and destination file paths along with a scale percentage to resize images seamlessly.
- **Versatile Applications:** Perfect for web development, image preprocessing in machine learning, or any scenario requiring efficient image resizing.
- **Powered by OpenCV:** Leverage the capabilities of the renowned OpenCV library for fast and effective image processing.

## Prerequisites 🛠️
- Python 3.10
- OpenCV library (`pip install opencv-python`)

## Usage 🚦
1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/DarakhshanMujtaba/image-resizer.git`
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** `cd image-resizer`
3. **Place Your Image:** Drop the image you want to resize into the same directory as the script.
4. **Update Configuration:**
    - Modify the `source` variable with your image filename.
    - Optionally, change the `destination` variable for a custom output filename.
    - Adjust the `scalePercent` variable to set the desired resize percentage.
5. **Run the Script:** `python image-resizer.py`

## Example 🚀
```bash
python image-resizer.py
```
